  abstract = {Many social science variables are composites of number of component variables. For example, a social class measure may be obtained as a sum of occupation, income, dwelling area, and education measures. Generally, the components represent different aspects or facets of an attribute. A special case occurs when the components presumably measure the same aspects of an attribute; this is the well-known case of reliability. We obtain an index of the quality of the composite, as indicated by the internal consistency among the components. The more highly interrelated the components are, the more adequately the composite represents the components. We make some rather natural assumptions and derive a lower-bound index, called coefficient theta, for the internal consistency of the composite. Theta provides a better lower bound for the measurement of internal consistency than a typically-used index, coefficient alpha, although it is more difficult to compute. We present a significance test to determine whether θ = 0 in the population. Finally, a number of examples are presented. In an appendix we prove that θ ≥ α.},

This note describes a methodology for scaling selected off-diagonal rows and columns of such a matrix to achieve positive definiteness. As a contrast to recently developed ridge procedures, the proposed method does not need variables to contain measurement errors. When minimum trace factor analysis is used to implement the theory, only correlations that are associated with Heywood cases are shrunk.},

  abstract = {The application of principal component analysis and parallel analysis to smoothed tetrachoric correlation matrices was investigated in a simulation study. To evaluate the effect of several smoothing algorithms, 360 different types of data sets were simulated. Under each simulated condition, two item sets, each fitting a unidimensional two-parameter logistic model, were combined with each other. The simulations differed in the size of the simulated item sets, the size of the person samples, the distribution of the difficulty and discrimination parameters, and the correlation between the person parameters. In general, the application of a smoothing algorithm led to an improved performance in the assessment of dimensionality, but minor differences between the three investigated smoothing algorithms were found. Procedures to apply two of the three investigated smoothing algorithms via R software packages are presented.},

  abstract = {The analysis of polychoric correlations via principal component analysis and exploratory factor analysis are well-known approaches to determine the dimensionality of ordered categorical items. However, the application of these approaches has been considered as critical due to the possible indefiniteness of the polychoric correlation matrix. A possible solution to this problem is the application of smoothing algorithms. This study compared the effects of three smoothing algorithms, based on the Frobenius norm, the adaption of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and on minimum-trace factor analysis, on the accuracy of various variations of parallel analysis by the means of a simulation study. We simulated different datasets which varied with respect to the size of the respondent sample, the size of the item set, the underlying factor model, the skewness of the response distributions and the number of response categories in each item. We found that a parallel analysis and principal component analysis of smoothed polychoric and Pearson correlations led to the most accurate results in detecting the number of major factors in simulated datasets when compared to the other methods we investigated. Of the methods used for smoothing polychoric correlation matrices, we recommend the algorithm based on minimum trace factor analysis.},

This problem arises in the finance industry, where the correlations are between stocks. For distance measured in two weighted Frobenius norms we characterize the solution using convex analysis. We show how the modified alternating projections method can be used to compute the solution for the more commonly used of the weighted Frobenius norms. In the finance application the original matrix has many zero or negative eigenvalues; we show that for a certain class of weights the nearest correlation matrix has correspondingly many zero eigenvalues and that this fact can be exploited in the computation.},

Some of these algorithms, depending on the initial value, may converge to points that are not the solution to the above problems, some converge linearly, and some are quadratically convergent but are somewhat difficult to implement. In this paper we propose modified Han–Powell algorithms to solve the MTFA and CMTFA problems. The modifications deal with the problem of multiple eigenvalues. The proposed algorithms are globally convergent and their speed is locally superlinear. We also give a modified Han–Powell algorithm to solve the weighted minimum trace factor analysis (WMTFA) problem. This method is also locally superlinear and is simpler to implement as compared to methods proposed earlier. Four examples are given to show the performance of the proposed algorithms. More generally, our experience with these algorithms shows that, starting at arbitrary points, they converge to the solution in a small number of iterations and reasonable time.},

While the factor extraction methods differed little from one another in quality of results for matrices more dissimilar to the factor analytic model, major differences in quality of results were associated with fewer factors in the major domain, higher proportion of variance from the major domain, and closeness of the simulation procedure to the factor analysis structural model.},
